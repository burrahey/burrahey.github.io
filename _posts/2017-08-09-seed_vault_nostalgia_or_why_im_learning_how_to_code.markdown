Did you know that somewhere near the North Pole, there's a seed vault that keeps a veritable Noah's Ark of all the major variety of seeds in case there's a global catastrophe? 

I recently heard [an interview](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/539005688/inside-the-global-seed-vault-where-the-history-and-future-of-agriculture-is-stor) on NPR's Fresh Air with the man, Cary Fowler, who was behind it all. In the interview, Fowler casually mentions a fascinating story about historical attempts to build and safeguard seed vaults, especially in the midst of war:

> "But the story that really springs to mind is a very poignant one from Leningrad, now St. Petersburg in Russia, which was surrounded for 900 days by the Nazis and bombarded. Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives. And the biggest and broadest seed collection in the world was at an institute in St. Petersburg. And it had been founded by a man named Nikolai Vavilov, who was a famous geneticist. And he really put together the first big global collections of seeds there for plant breeding in the old Soviet Union. But he ran afoul of Lysenko and Stalin. And in the end, during the war, he was imprisoned. And he died anonymously of starvation, ironically, in prison.

> But his staff remained there on St. Isaac's Square in St. Petersburg during the bombardment and the encirclement of the city by the Nazis. And about a dozen of his staff members actually perished, died mostly of starvation and starvation-related ailments rather than eat the seeds that they had in the building. The curator of the rice collection died sitting at his desk with bags of rice on the desk. And I remember as a much younger man in 1985 going for a visit to this facility, the Vavilov Institute, and asking, well, you know, what was happening here as the staff were slowly and collectively starving to death? And the answer I got was that they thought that the world was going up into flames. But they were students of Vavilov, and they understood the importance of crop diversity. And they thought that that crop diversity would - was what was going to reestablish agriculture after this hell ended."

Can you imagine if the burden of propogating our species lies upon you and you alone? What courage, strength and kindness these men showed. What an incredible mission: to end famine but also to ensure the survival of humankind. I think that feeling like you're a part of something bigger is a very powerful motivator. Indeed, for many, what you do is a core part of your identity.

I'm not saying that learning to code is my seed vault. FAR FROM IT. I'm a child of immigrants: hardworking people who defied impossible odds to give their children a life filled with love and every advantage. The stories of Valivov and his students seem romantic, tragic and uncomparable to anything I've experienced. The story is inspiring, but not exactly relatable. I shared the story first and foremost, because it's the most amazing thing I've learned about today, but also to highlight what's possible when you live for a mission that's bigger than you.

I've been sort of lost for a few years, and have always been drawn to and envious of people who knew exactly what their passion was. It was clear to me that when you have direction, you accelerate and go farther in life. It's hard to figure out what you want to do, and even more intimidating when you live in a big, beautiful city full of the smartest, most passionate people who already have a purpose (sup NYC). 

If I had to pick a quote about why I'm learning to code, I'd rather choose a quote from [Iris Smyles' book, "Dating Tips for the Unemployed":](https://www.amazon.com/Dating-Tips-Unemployed-Iris-Smyles/dp/0544703383/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)

For the first time in my life, I feel like I may have found a home. I love the culture of programming (even though I'm writing this a few days after the infamous [Google document](http://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320) about women and miniorities surfaced). I'm excited to be able to build something of value one day, maybe something [funny](https://processing.org/examples/tickle.html) or even something that ultimately helps people. I adore the feeling of solving a problem or building something new and seeing it work. I [love the feeling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/199707/finding-flow) of working on something for hours, without even noticing. 

One of my favorite things about coding is that there are a million free tutorials on the internet about anything you'd want to learn - I suppose this is the great internet seed vault. Any time you get stuck, there's an answer, because someone somewhere took the time to write an answer, often with great care. What an incredible community.

When I was in college, I was one of two girls in my 80-person "Theory of Computing". I found coding to be [incredibly alienating](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding). No one in class wanted to work with me, and I was an extrovert who enjoyed chatting with people above all else. It made perfect sense back then for me not to pursue becoming a developer. Over the years, something changed. I now crave technical and intellectual challenges above all, but also find programming to be more collaborative these days. I have friends who enjoy coding too! 

I'm excited to see where I go from here.
